# Memory-Game---Flipping-Card-Challenge

This repository showcases an engaging mini project where I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a thrilling memory game. 🃏💻 
Players are challenged to match pairs of cards by flipping them over and remembering their positions. 
🌟 The winner earns the ultimate prize - a virtual trophy! 🏆 Through this project, I explored interactive web development techniques, including event handling and DOM manipulation. 
It's not just a game; it's a test of memory and agility! 💡💫
